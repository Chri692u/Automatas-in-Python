Implementation of finite automata in python
	- DFA.py contains the DFA implementation
		+ Constuctor is a 5-tuple similar to math
		+ Accept "runs" the DFA on a input string
		+ Eval checks if the DFA is valid
		+ Draw outputs the DFA into a SVG file
	
	- NFA.py contains the NFA implementation
		+ Constuctor is a 5-tuple similar to math
		+ Accept "runs" the NFA on a input string
		+ Eval checks if the NFA is valid
		+ Draw outputs the NFA into a SVG file
		- Limited non-determinism
